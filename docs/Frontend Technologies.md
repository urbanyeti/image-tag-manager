## Electron

Electron is an open-source framework developed and maintained by GitHub. It allows for the development of desktop GUI applications using web technologies. It combines the Chromium rendering engine and the Node.js runtime, allowing you to build applications with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. In simple words, it lets you write desktop applications that look and behave like web applications.

## React

React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces, particularly single-page applications. Itâ€™s used for handling the view layer in web and mobile apps. React allows you to design simple views for each state in your application, and it will efficiently update and render the right components when your data changes. React views are declarative, which means they are more predictable and easier to debug.

## Redux

Redux is a predictable state container designed to help you write JavaScript apps that behave consistently across different environments and are easy to test. It provides you with a store that holds your application state, and you can use it to write functions that respond to actions and modify the state. Redux is often used with React, but it can be used with any other view library.

## Webpack

Webpack is a static module bundler for modern JavaScript applications. When webpack processes your application, it internally builds a dependency graph from one or many entry points and uses it to generate a new set of packages (commonly known as "bundles"). These bundles are comprised of the very modules needed in your application in the correct order. Webpack can help you to manage, bundle, and serve your resources (like JavaScript, CSS, and images files) in a way that is optimized for the speed of development and the size of delivery.
